The goal is to provide you with a clearer and more insightful perspective on these missions.\n","\n","With a blend of primary and secondary research, the data has been meticulously refined, setting the stage for a more user-friendly experience. Leveraging the power of Python, I've conducted transformative cleaning and structuring, paving the way for an engaging data exploration.\n","\n","As we journey through the cosmos of data, the focus will soon shift towards Exploratory Data Analysis and the art of storytelling through Tableau. Join me on this voyage as we unearth the tales hidden within the numbers and charts.\n","\n","If you find my work intriguing, I invite you to upvote, share, and connect with me on LinkedIn. Let's discuss insights, collaborate, and continue exploring the endless possibilities that data holds!\n","\n","Let's embark on this exciting odyssey together!\n","\n","Connect with me on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/commandantekaustav) 🚀\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"dfc6f8aa","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-07T19:46:20.72922Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-07T19:46:20.728364Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-07T19:46:20.752649Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-07T19:46:20.751621Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.042246,"end_time":"2023-09-07T19:46:20.754982","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-09-07T19:46:20.712736","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/kaggle/input/all-space-missions-from-1957/Space_Corrected.csv\n"]}],"source":["# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n","# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n","# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n","\n","import numpy as np #
